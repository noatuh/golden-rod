        <h2>About the Goldenrod</h2>
        <p>The goldenrod is the state flower of Kentucky, chosen for its vibrant yellow blooms that brighten the landscape in late summer and fall.</p>
        <p>Goldenrods belong to the genus Solidago, which includes about 100 to 120 species of flowering plants in the aster family, Asteraceae. These plants are native to North America, with a few species found in South America and Eurasia.</p>
        <p>Goldenrods are primarily herbaceous perennials that thrive in open areas such as meadows, prairies, and savannas. They are recognized for their dense clusters of small yellow flowers that create striking, plume-like flower heads.</p>
        <p>Historically, goldenrods have been used in traditional medicine to treat various ailments, including inflammation and kidney stones. They also play a crucial role in supporting pollinators, providing essential nectar for bees, butterflies, and other insects.</p>
        <p>Despite their beauty and ecological importance, goldenrods are often mistakenly blamed for causing hay fever. The true culprit is usually ragweed, which blooms at the same time and releases large amounts of pollen.</p>
