        <h2>Goldenrod</h2>
        <p>The goldenrod is the state flower of Kentucky. It is known for its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and fall.</p>
        <img src="img.jpg" alt="Goldenrod Flower" class="flower-image">
        <p>Goldenrods are a genus of about 100 to 120 species of flowering plants in the aster family, Asteraceae. They are native to North America, including Mexico; a few species are native to South America and Eurasia.</p>
        <p>Goldenrods are mostly herbaceous perennial species found in open areas such as meadows, prairies, and savannas. They are known for their clusters of small yellow flowers that form dense, plume-like flower heads.</p>
        <p>Goldenrods have been used in traditional medicine for various ailments, including inflammation and kidney stones. They are also important for pollinators, providing nectar for bees, butterflies, and other insects.</p>
        <p>Despite their beauty, goldenrods are sometimes mistakenly blamed for causing hay fever. The real culprit is usually ragweed, which blooms at the same time and produces large amounts of pollen.</p>
